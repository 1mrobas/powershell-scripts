PowerShell, PowerCLI, and Python Scripts
================

This repository contains a number of scripts that I have written or enhanced to make day-to-day life easier for administrators, engineers, and architects. These are provided for free to the community under an [Apache License v2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). I also have a number of [PowerShell related blog posts](http://wahlnetwork.com/?s=powershell) at Wahl Network for those interested.
