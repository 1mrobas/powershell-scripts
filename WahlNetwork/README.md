This is the Wahl Network module folder. To use it, copy the folder along with any of my cmdlets to your PowerShell module path. This is typically:

    C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules

Then, import the module:

    Import-Module WahlNetwork

You can now use any of the cmdlets that you copied over. For a full list, use this command:

    Get-Command -Module WahlNetwork

Enjoy.
